      <h1>An Impossible Material, and the Three Things Nobody's Asking</h1>

      <p>I came across an article a few days ago about a material that shouldn't exist. Researchers at Wageningen University &mdash; in the Netherlands &mdash; had made something they're calling a "compleximer." Amber-coloured stuff that can be blown and shaped like glass, but bounces like plastic when you drop it. Self-heals when you heat it. Fully recyclable.</p>

      <p>The headline called it "impossible." That word stuck with me &mdash; so I went looking for the actual science.</p>

      <p>What I found was more interesting than the material itself.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>What They Actually Made</h2>

      <p>The idea is disarmingly simple. Most plastics hold their chains together with permanent chemical bonds &mdash; strong, but once they break, they're broken. Glass ionomers use ionic bonds but need water to stay workable. Compleximers do something different: they use opposite electrical charges along the polymer chains (like tiny magnets pulling them together) with hydrophobic spacers grafted on to stop the charges gripping too tightly.</p>

      <p>The result &mdash; a material held together entirely by tuneable electrostatic attraction. No water needed. No permanent bonds to break.</p>

      <p>This came out of the doctoral work of Sophie van Lange at Wageningen, supervised by Professor Jasper van der Gucht. Her <a href="https://doi.org/10.18174/681447">thesis</a> &mdash; "Charge ahead" &mdash; was completed June 2025. There are exactly four published papers: the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adi3606">founding paper</a> in <em>Science Advances</em> (2024), a study on ionic liquid plasticisers in <em>Macromolecules</em> (2025), a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1039/d5sm01081k">molecular dynamics simulation</a> in <em>Soft Matter</em> (2026), and the one that caught my attention &mdash; a paper in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-68124-2"><em>Nature Communications</em></a> (January 2026) showing that compleximers break a fundamental rule of glass physics.</p>

      <p>Four papers. One research group. A few grams of material.</p>

      <h2>The Rule They Broke</h2>

      <p>This is the bit that made me sit up.</p>

      <p>There's a well-established correlation in glass physics between how steeply a material's viscosity changes near its glass transition (its "fragility") and how uniformly its internal structure relaxes. For decades &mdash; across hundreds of materials, thermoplastics, vitrimers, metallic glasses &mdash; the rule has held: strong glass formers (low fragility, easy to process) relax uniformly. Fragile ones (steep viscosity change, harder to work with) relax in a stretched/uneven way that dissipates more mechanical energy.</p>

      <p>The implication was always that you had to choose. Easy processing <em>or</em> good impact resistance. Not both.</p>

      <p>Compleximers show the opposite relationship. They've got the low fragility of silica &mdash; processable, well-behaved &mdash; combined with the broad, energy-dissipating relaxation of a tough polymer. Van Lange's team surveyed ionic liquids, polymerised ionic liquids, and ionomers &mdash; they all follow this inverted trend. It's not an anomaly. It's a feature of long-range ionic interactions.</p>

      <p>That's not incremental science. That's a new corner of the material design space.</p>

      <h2>What's Missing</h2>

      <p>This is where it gets interesting &mdash; and where I think the real story lives.</p>

      <p>There's a useful way to think about any system &mdash; whether it's a material, a supply chain, or a power grid. You ask three questions: what independent mechanisms hold it together? What feedback loops keep it stable? And what's conspicuously absent?</p>

      <p><strong>What holds compleximers together:</strong> three independent mechanisms &mdash; the electrostatic crosslinks between opposite charges, the hydrophobic spacer interactions that moderate bond strength, and polymer chain entanglements for structural integrity. When plasticised with ionic liquids, a fourth mechanism kicks in.</p>

      <p><strong>What feedback loops sustain them:</strong> the self-healing cycle is real &mdash; heat increases charge mobility, opposite charges find each other and re-associate, crack seals. There's a recyclability loop (process, use, collect, reprocess). And the inverted fragility relation itself is a feedback loop &mdash; in normal materials, increasing interaction strength makes processing harder. In compleximers, stronger ionic interactions simultaneously improve processability <em>and</em> toughness. That's a loop that reinforces rather than trades off.</p>

      <p><strong>What's conspicuously absent:</strong> this is the list that matters.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Zero biocompatibility data.</strong> Nobody's run even a basic cytotoxicity test.</li>
        <li><strong>Zero biobased version.</strong> Current chemistry is entirely fossil-derived. Biobased alternatives get mentioned as future work in every paper &mdash; no data.</li>
        <li><strong>No long-term performance data.</strong> No ageing studies, no fatigue testing, no creep measurements.</li>
        <li><strong>Gram-scale production only.</strong> The researchers themselves say they've got "a few grams."</li>
        <li><strong>Unknown environmental fate.</strong> The ionic liquid plasticisers have documented ecotoxicity in other contexts. Nobody's studied what happens when compleximers degrade.</li>
        <li><strong>Binary formulations only.</strong> Every study uses one polycation and one polyanion. No multi-component systems, no composites, no fillers.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Six significant gaps. And the research field itself is fragmented &mdash; at least five communities working on related problems (solid polyelectrolyte complexes, coacervate hydrogels, ionomer physics, self-healing polymers, glass transition theory) with almost no cross-pollination. The Wageningen group is the only team bridging solid-state polymer chemistry with glass transition physics.</p>

      <h2>Three Ways This Gets Into Healthcare</h2>

      <p>Here's the thing nobody seems to be asking &mdash; what if this material has medical applications?</p>

      <p>The properties map surprisingly well. A self-healing material that's solvent-resistant, processable at moderate temperatures, fully recyclable. The entire field of polyelectrolyte complexes in healthcare &mdash; wound dressings, drug delivery, tissue engineering &mdash; currently relies on hydrogels. Water-based, soft, temporary. Nobody's tested a solid-state polyelectrolyte complex in a biomedical context.</p>

      <p>When you look at the gaps above and ask which ones you'd need to fill to get to a specific application &mdash; a clear ranking emerges. Each missing piece adds cost, and it adds it superlinearly. Filling one gap is manageable. Filling six simultaneously is an order of magnitude harder. So you want the application that needs the fewest gaps filled.</p>

      <p><strong>1. Wound healing dressings &mdash; 2 to 3 years.</strong> Self-healing maps directly to wound closure. You'd need basic cytotoxicity testing and skin irritation data &mdash; that's it. Existing polyelectrolyte hydrogel wound dressings provide regulatory precedent, so this could go through a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/premarket-submissions-selecting-and-preparing-correct-submission/premarket-notification-510k">510(k)</a> pathway as a Class II device. Main risk &mdash; whether the ionic liquid plasticisers leach and cause local toxicity. If they do, you reformulate without them. Cost: $2&ndash;5M. Gaps to fill: one or two.</p>

      <p><strong>2. Dental restorative materials &mdash; 3 to 4 years.</strong> Compleximers are shaped like glass &mdash; and dentistry already uses glass ionomers extensively (there are <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">223 clinical trials</a> involving dental ionomers on ClinicalTrials.gov). Self-healing addresses the primary failure mode of dental restorations: microcrack propagation. Chemistry is conceptually similar (ionic crosslinks) and the regulatory pathway is established. The catch &mdash; current plateau modulus is around 200 MPa. Tooth enamel is closer to 70&ndash;90 GPa. That's a factor of 100 to bridge, probably through composite reinforcement. Solvable but not trivial. Cost: $5&ndash;10M. Gaps to fill: two or three.</p>

      <p><strong>3. Orthopaedic fixation &mdash; 5 to 8 years.</strong> Impact resistance for temporary fixation devices. If a biobased version were developed it could potentially be bioresorbable &mdash; body absorbs the implant as bone heals. But this requires Class III regulatory approval, a full biocompatibility battery, fatigue testing to millions of cycles, animal studies, and a biobased formulation that doesn't yet exist. Cost: $30M+. Gaps to fill: four to six.</p>

      <p>Pattern's clear. Fewer structural absences to resolve means a faster/cheaper path. Each additional gap doesn't add cost linearly &mdash; it multiplies it.</p>

      <h2>The $10,000 Experiment</h2>

      <p>If I were advising the Wageningen team &mdash; or anyone watching this space &mdash; there's one experiment that matters more than any other right now.</p>

      <p>An ISO 10993-5 cytotoxicity screening. You expose cells to the material and see if they survive. Costs $5,000 to $10,000. Takes two to four weeks. And it's the gate that every healthcare application has to pass through.</p>

      <p>If compleximers pass basic cytotoxicity &mdash; an entire new material class opens up for healthcare. Wound dressings, dental materials, eventually implants &mdash; all become plausible development programmes.</p>

      <p>If they fail, you know before spending millions. Reformulate without the ionic liquid, change the charge-carrying chemistry, test again.</p>

      <p>Right now, nobody's run this test. Four papers, a PhD thesis, a <em>Nature Communications</em> publication, international press coverage &mdash; and the simplest, cheapest experiment that would determine whether this material has a future in medicine hasn't been done.</p>

      <p>That's what you find when you read beyond the headline.</p>
